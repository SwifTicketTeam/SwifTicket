# Release Notes for SwifTicket

## Phase 1 â€“ Frontend Foundation

Release Date: June 18, 2025  
Version: Pre Beta v0.0

### Highlights

- Created `Auth.vue` as the main authentication container
- Built `Login.vue` and `Register.vue` as dynamic components
- Implemented switching logic between Login and Signup views
- Developed `Card.vue` to handle component toggling and display information
- Achieved responsive layout using Flexbox
- Established a clean, modular component structure
- Added Forgot Password and Submit button
- `Login.vue` and `Register.vue` had the same styles. So created an external style sheet to monitor both of their styles at the same time.
